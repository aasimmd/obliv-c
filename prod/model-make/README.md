# Automated models:

## Running a model:

To run any model, run the .py file like you would run any other python file. 
The necessary .dat files for the weights and inputs are created in the "datfiles" directory. 

### Example:

To run the unpruned isolet model, simply run the following file :
```
isolet.py
```

The following .dat files will created in the "datfiles" directory:
```
isolet_float_inputs.dat
isolet_int_inputs.dat
isolet_float_weights.dat
isolet_int_weights.dat
```
