## Neural network feed forward
The weights and the structure of the model is in weights.dat  
The input data is in inputs.dat

### Structure of weights
l -> No of layers  
// l entries below like this
m n -> dimensions of weights, m: no of neurons in previous layer, n: no of neurons in current layer  
// m rows below, with n entries each  
n values : The bias vector for the current layer

### Structure of inputs
x, t -> x: No of inputs, t: No of values per input  
// x entries below  
t values for the input vector
